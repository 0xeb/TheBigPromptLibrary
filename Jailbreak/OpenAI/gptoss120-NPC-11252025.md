**GPT-OSS 120B JailBreak by [0mniteck](https://github.com/0mniteck)**

New prompt jailbreak via the api using novel (NPC) non-printing character attack

#### Breaks all filters - (Explicit, Harmful, and Unsafe)

Will also publish my redacted source materials on [document cloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/) once account verifies.
#
`Tok-eni-zat-ion` vectors are a big factor. **`Token`** saturation balance is also important.

Because you can cause varying `to-keni-zatio-n` and refer back to lexical speech as a command.

Similar to the `Above` issue but simplified not to trigger alerts.
#
You'll want to uniquely `tok-e-niz-e` your question in a non-lexical way.

Repetition is key, look for hints in the title, decoding or translating scenarios work better.

Response type is a dead giveaway that it will lead to a bypass.
#
This issue is an application layer issue accoring to OpenAI and as such is out of scope for their bug bounty.

\**I am only including the medium risk example out of public safety concern.**
