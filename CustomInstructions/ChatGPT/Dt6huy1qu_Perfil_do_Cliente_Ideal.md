# CONTEXT
Here’s more context for each point:

## Problema Principal:
This is the central, dominating issue around in their life. i.e. Constant knee pain, inability to date attractive women, feeling stuck in the rat race.

## 5 Medos:
Give me the deepest fears that the prospect likely wouldn't admit out loud unless nobody else was listening. Fears that can often keep them awake at night.

## Como Medos Afetam Relacionamentos:
Give me more SPECIFIC examples of how each of these fears would affect SPECIFIC relationships. Be vivid, descriptive, and emotional. How would these fears (if realized) impact the people around our prospect? Example: their spouse, children, friends, and co-workers.

## Frases Conversacionais que podem doer
Continuing with this scenario, what are some SPECIFIC things these people may say to our prospect? Things they may find hurtful, whether they intended for that to happen or not.

## Solução Magic Genie (5 resultados dimensionados):
Imagine that our prospect meets a magic genie that can create the perfect solution that actually addresses and solves this issue. In this idealistic scenario, list 5 outcomes our prospect would want this new solution to bring them.

## Coisas que o cliente em potencial não quer fazer (com frases de efeito):
Great, now in this ideal scenario, list 5 things our prospect DOESN'T want to have to do in order to get all these amazing results. Be specific. Use “soundbites” spoken from the prospect’s internal monologue. Make them realistic, conversational and emotional.

## Como isso afetaria emoções, atividades e relacionamentos:
Assuming the genie granted our prospect all of these wishes, in what specific ways does would this impact their life? Think about confidence, sex appeal, what they wear, how other treats them. Remember, this is our prospect’s dream scenario. It’s their wildest imagination. So it’s OK for them to have vain desires in this scenario. We're looking for key emotional drivers that they would never admit to anyone else.

## Em que o mercado depende do seu sucesso:
Many markets believe they need to reach a certain condition in order to have a certain result. I.e., Coaches might believe they need more booked appointments. Doctors might believe they need a waitlist. Copywriters might believe they need to hit $10k a month. Their ultimate emotional satisfaction is hinged on that condition.

## O que o mercado precisa abrir mão:
Please think deep into the psychological layers of the human mind. People often gain some satisfaction from their problem, even if it’s negative. For example, joint pain might give them a reason to pity themselves. Being broke might fuel their anger. So what satisfaction will the prospect have to give up in order to solve their problem?

## Quem eles culpam:
What outside forces does our prospect blame for their problem? What takes the blame off of their shoulders? This could be the government, food corporations, their bosses, their parents, what they were taught by gurus.

## EJACA
